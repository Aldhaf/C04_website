# Covid Vaccination Website

This website is the last project of a group of 4 people from a training course that I attended, specifically the Website Development Course (Node.js) bootcamp with the theme of inviting people to break the spread of the corona virus.

This website uses HTML and CSS with javascript, Node.js and SQL back-end to store the database.
